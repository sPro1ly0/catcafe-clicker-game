## Summary

I did another hackathon with <a href="https://github.com/MintbeanHackathons">Mintbean</a>! We made our own idle clicker games in 4 hours. Today I wanted to challenge myself by using vanilla JavaScript and take a break from React. I also have been watching some videos about cat cafes so I let that inspire my clicker project. The goal of the game is just to get as many coins as you can. You can buy cats, hire baristas, and add items to your cafe menu. 

The main thing I learned about was using the setInterval method. Plus, the logic behind creating a game takes time. I wasn't sure how my game was going to turn out, but I got a decent foundation working. It was also very fun to play with everyone's projects!
